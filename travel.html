Having lived on three different continents, I sometimes take for granted the frequent trips I make to visit friends and family around the world (or rather, the Western hemisphere).</p>

You can see the cities I've <span class="blue"><b>lived in</b></span> and <b>visited</b> in the map below.</br>

<div id="mapdiv" style="width: 640px; height: 400px;margin-top: 0px">
	<script src="{{ site.baseurl }}/map.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</div>
<div style="color:#999;text-align: center;">Zoom in and out using the buttons on the left. Hover over a marker to see the name of the city.</div>
