Co-authored paper investigating 2D graphene membranes and their potential in high-pressure separation & desalination technologies; facilitated acquisition of critical data by designing automated data acquisition infrastructure

**Supervisor comments**: After I made the criterion clear, Chris made his own choice to contribute more to the project. I am impressed how quickly he responded to my constructive criticism and went above and beyond to adjust his schedule.

He independently taught himself the necessary skills to create relatively complicated data acquisition software, which was crucial to the project. He is a nice and sweet person, and I enjoy working with him
