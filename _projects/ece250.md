Despite advances that have seen sensors become ubiquitous in modern tech, how we interact with sensing technologies has for the most part not changed. 
The demand for novel flexible and conformable sensors is particularly present in health and wellness sensors designed to be compatible with humans.

Apart from participating in device fabrication and testing, I also used my previous R&D experience to plan and execute our design approach. As team lead, I spearheaded efforts to summarize our work in a 50-page report and was responsible for preparing our research poster & seminar presentation.
