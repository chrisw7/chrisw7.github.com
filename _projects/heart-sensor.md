<div class="intro uw">Ultra-conformable, ultra-sensitive graphene polymer heart sensors</div>

Despite advances that have seen sensors become ubiquitous in modern technology, how we interact with sensing technologies remains fundamentally the same. There is a particular demand for health sensors capable of resolving subtle physiological signals without sacrificing the flexibility or bio-compatibility of the device.

By combining the malleability of Silly Putty with the extraordinary properties of graphene <b>we successfully fabricated ultra-conformable elastoresistive prototype sensors robust enough to detect arterial blood pressures as low as 40 mmHg</b> (roughly half of a healthy diastolic pressure).

<div style="color:#999;text-align: center;">Characterization of our nanocomposite sensors confirmed the presence of sub-micron graphene sheets that imbued the graphene-infused putty with a pressure-dependent conductivity (without rendering it stiff and brittle).</div>

Inspired by a <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6317/1257">publication</a> from a group at Trinity College Dublin who were the first to demonstrate the potential of the nanocomposite, this design project was the culmination of all of the skills I'd acquired from as an undergraduate. 

My experience <a href="/graphene">fabricating graphene devices</a> at <span class="mit">MIT</span> proved invaluable throughout the project, as did my time <a href="/ecg">prototyping and designing biomedical technology</a> under Prof. Deen at <span class="mc">McMaster University</span>. Our project was supervised by <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/chemistry/people-profiles/vivek-maheshwari">Prof. Vivek Maheshwari</a> whose expertise in wearable sensors, multi-functional materials & devices, and nanoscale electrodes also contributed to the overall success of the project.

Instead of using CVD graphene, the graphene used in our prototype sensors was obtained by means of the liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite powder in a stabilizing organic solvent. The resulting graphene solution was mixed with condensation-polymerized PDMS to form the elastoresistive putty.

As project lead, I spearheaded our team's efforts and summarized our work in a 50-page <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_ASe1-VFHos_GEW2bCAP4BygaYnB7fmK/view" >report</a>. I also was responsible for the preparation of the research <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DkCD2oqYFvzf0BqwaTBsedLkBu5OIjoM/view?usp=sharing">poster</a> & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9HVaffnI7U">seminar</a> that we presented at the Capstone Design Symposium. Full versions of the poster and report are available in the links at the bottom of the page.
