As the VP of Networking & Outreach for the Nanotechnology Engineering Student Society, my main undertaking was desigining, executing, and analyzing a survey of the graduating nanotechnology engineering class.

With only ~55% participation we elected not to publish the results of the survey publicly, but I was still able to make some interesting observations from my preliminary analysis.

To analyze the 25k line spreadsheet of data generated from the survey I relied heavily on <b>Excel PivotCharts</b> and the python `pandas` library for analysis.
